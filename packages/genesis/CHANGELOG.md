## 0.1.0-rc.1 - 2023-07-18

Initial release.

This package contains all genesis state files (currently for Goerli, Mainnet and Sepolia) previously included in the `@ethereumjs/blockchain` package, see PR [#2768](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2768), [#2815](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2815 and [#2886](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2886)) for package introduction.

This is to reduce bundle and distribution sizes for other packages, mainly Blockchain, EVM and VM, since genesis state information (particularly the large Mainnet state) is often not necessary for large parts of API usage.
